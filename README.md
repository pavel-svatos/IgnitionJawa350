# IgnitionJawa350
Substitution of mechanical ignition for famous motorbike Jawa 350. Based on ESP8266.

This electrical ignition for Jawa350 was created for testing purposes. The mechanical 
contacts were replaced by one optocupler and screening. The electrical ignition consists
of ESP8266, step up 6V -> 12V power supply, mosfets and few next parts.

The Ignition ofset is controlled according to actual rpm from -3° to -28°, simultaneously
is controlled the duration of feeding power to inductors.

This ignition was tested, seems OK. The power consumption is lower now -> better battery
charging during low rpm.
