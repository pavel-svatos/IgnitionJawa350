# IgnitionJawa350
Substitution of mechanical ignition for famous motorbike Jawa 350. Based on ESP8266.

This electrical ignition for Jawa350 was created for testing purposes. The mechanical 
contacts were replaced by one optocupler and screening (see photos). The electrical ignition consists
of ESP8266, step up 6V -> 12V power supply, mosfets and few next parts.

The Ignition ofset is controlled according to actual rpm from -3° to -28°, simultaneously  is controlled
the duration of feeding power to inductors.

After few test rides it looks that ignition is fully working without any resets, even
the maximum motorbike speed was increased.

Please consider this ignition as a beta version, so stay close to your house. ;-)

Try and enjoy...
